# Fat Free Wunderlist

**This gem can only be used on an existing [Fat Free CRM](http://www.fatfreecrm.com/) application**

Using an after_filter on the Task controller,  this gem will send your task to your existing Wunderlist account.  It sends the task using Action Mailer (email) directly to your Wunderlist inbox or a specific list.  Wunderlist allows posting tasks through emails, and the process is described on this [blog post](http://blog.wunderlist.com/post/6521016265/secret-features-part-3-add-tasks-via-mail).  

# Features

	* Important Tasks - Tasks marked due as "As Soon As Possible" or "Today" will be flagged as important in your Wunderlist inbox/list.
	* Post to a List - Just supply the list in the initializer file, and all tasks will be added to that list.
	* Flags Assets -  If the task involves an account, contact, opportunity, etc,  then the asset name and type is added to the Wunderlist inbox/list.

## Limitations

Since we are using the email approach,  you will not be able to update or delete tasks in your Wunderlist account through your Fat Free CRM.  You will need to manage them in your Wunderlist account.  Also,  this gem only supports one Wunderlist account and list.  If you wish to change that,  please send me a pull request with your updates.

## Requirements

	* Ruby 1.9.2 or later.
	* Rails 3.0 or later.
	* Fat Free CRM 10.0  or later.
	* A Wunderlist Account
